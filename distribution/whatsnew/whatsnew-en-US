Improved PDF Operations & Stability

• Fixed critical issue where cancelling operations (Compress, Merge) would continue in the background.
• Enhanced PDF Compression: Shared images (like logos) are now reused, significantly reducing file size.
• Improved memory handling for large PDF Merge and OCR operations to prevent crashes.
• Added strict cancellation support for all long-running tasks.
