Build flavor implementation for dual-store deployment

• Implemented Play Store and F-Droid build flavors
• Play Store: ML Kit OCR (smaller APK + runtime download)
• F-Droid: Tesseract OCR (larger APK, fully open source)
• OCR feature available in both builds
• Improved deployment workflow with better error handling
